## Lab1
1) Construct histogram and graph of the empirical distribution function
2) Find:
    * average value of the sample;
    * sample variance;
    * standard error;
    * fashion;
    * median;
    * first, second and third quartiles;
    * box with a mustache;
    * standard deviation;
    * kurtosis;
    * asymmetry;
    * minimum, maximum
3) Accepting as a null hypothesis H0: "the general population, from
which the sample is extracted has a normal distribution ", check it,
using the Pearson criterion at a significance level of α = 0.025;
4) Find the confidence intervals for the mathematical expectation and
standard deviation with reliability γ = 0.95.

## Lab2

It is required to investigate the behavior of the specified pair of statistical criteria suitable for solving the same problem, 
compare the power and the achieved significance levels, and draw a conclusion about the limits of applicability of the criteria. 
It is necessary for each of the criteria to construct graphs of the dependence of the achieved significance levels and power estimates on the parameters, 
and to show in which areas of the parameter change it is preferable to use one or another criterion. 
To obtain smoother graphs, it is recommended to apply both criteria to the same samples, rather than generate them separately for each. 
For each experiment, i.e. for each specific vector of parameters, it is necessary to generate at least 5000 samples for the estimates 
of the power and average p-value and at least 10000 to estimate the probability of a type I error 
(if the corresponding values of the parameters are included in the region specified in the task), the obtained results are averaged.

## Lab3
0) Come up with an ergodic Markov chain consisting of 8 states (do not forget that there should always be probabilities of transition from state i to
state i - that is, the probability of remaining in the current state);
1) Write down the matrix of transition probabilities and set the initial state vector, accuracy and number of steps;
2) Simulate the Markov chain step by step with two different initial vectors of state probabilities and obtain two final vectors (to which the simulation led), as well as graphs of the change in the standard deviation at each step of the simulation for both initial vectors;
3) Solve the problem analytically, and get a vector;
4) Check that the two vectors from point 2 and the vector from point 3 are similar.
